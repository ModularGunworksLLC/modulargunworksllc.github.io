This pointer is not to be used with jacket bullets regardless of type but for people who do home reloading it is ideal for drilling out hollow cavities in the noses of cast bullets.</p><p> With the stop collar on the case trimmer set the depth of the hollow point is controlled. For extremely short and long rounds a short or long trimmer base may be required. As with all Forster products this pointer is high quality.</p>",

With its easy-to-use digital pressure altimeter you have the perfect instrument for any outdoor activity - get conditions in seconds right in the palm of your hand. In addition to predicting weather activity barometric pressure also influences a bullet&rsquo;s trajectory which is why the Kestrel 2500NV is used by shooters and hunters when accuracy is important.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;The Kestrel 2500NV has a night-vision preserving backlight which helps users to sustain natural night vision. The NV&#39;s backlight incorporates an optical filter to reduce overall brightness and minimize blue and green spectrum light to preserve night vision. Additionally NV backlights are also much dimmer than a standard backlight making it more difficult to detect with the naked eye in night operations. This backlight appears soft greyish pink&nbsp;<em>not red</em> and is still in the visible spectrum so it is not compatible with night-vision equipment.<br /><br />It takes 30 to 45 minutes for the average eye to adapt to darkness and maximize night vision. Even a short burst of white yellow green or blue light &ldquo;bleaches out&rdquo; the rod cell photoreceptors in the eye and causes night blindness until the entire adaptation process can take place again. Light in the red spectrum does not cause this &ldquo;bleaching out&rdquo; preventing night blindness and night vision fatigue.</p><p>Kestrel Weather &amp; Environmental Meters are designed &amp; manufactured in the U.S.A and are backed by our 5-year warranty.

To get your fire going all you&rsquo;ll need is a small pile of dry grass wood shavings or other flammable materials. Hold the magnesium firesteel shaft close to the pile and quickly draw the striker down the shaft at a right angle to produce sparks. The sparks will ignite the dry materials and as the fire becomes established you will be able to gradually add larger materials to the fire until it is at the desired size. The Kershaw Fire Starter also lights camp stoves and gas barbeques. In an emergency the brilliant spark can be used as an emergency signal.</p><p>The Fire Starter itself is compact enough to fit comfortably in your driest pocket - and of course it makes an essential addition to your dry-box supplies or survival gear.</p>",

From opening packages to breaking down boxes the Cinder?s got you covered. What?s more you know the Cinder is built for performance. For one thing it?s designed by Rick Hinderer well known for the real-world practicality of his knife designs. For another it?s precision manufactured by Kershaw known for our top-notch fit and finish.</p>  <p>The blade is just 1.4 inches long but because of the upswept tip it offers plenty of useful cutting edge. On a knife this small creating a solid grip is tough. Rick designed the grip so that your hand comes forward past the pivot point enabling a full three-finger grip on this smaller knife. The handle is faux G-10 textured to enhance grip even more; the blade has a stonewashed finish that looks great and hides scratches.</p>  <p>The secure locking liner features cutout embellishments revealed by the design of the handle scale. This design also makes it easier to open this manual-opening blade and easier to unlock the liner lock to close it. The large lanyard hole makes attaching the Cinder to your key chain or pack simple.</p>  <p>And you might have noticed the bottle opener built into the back end. Yeah we thought you did.

Leading knife makers compare it to AUS-8. It retains its edge well but is not as abrasion resistant as VG-10 or S30V. Edge stability is good which means the edge can be thinned well.

      "description": "<p>If you&rsquo;ve been craving a Rick Hinderer knife but couldn&rsquo;t quite part with the bucks your last excuse has just disappeared. The Cryo is the result of collaboration between Rick Hinderer and the design and production engineers at Kershaw. And we&rsquo;re sure it will satisfy both your Hinderer craving and the demands of your wallet.</p><p>A classic Rick Hinderer design the Cryo is built of pure stainless steel coated with matte grey titanium carbo-nitride for a no-fuss look that lets the design shine through. Like all Rick&rsquo;s knives the Cryo benefits from Rick&rsquo;s real world experience as a fire fighter and EMT. It&rsquo;s designed to be a sturdy knife that&rsquo;s still aesthetically pleasing and feels good in the hand.</p><p>For secure blade lock up the Cryo offers a tough frame lock with lockbar stabilization. The Cryo also features Kershaw&rsquo;s SpeedSafe assisted opening for fast and easy one-handed opening. Access it with either the built-in flipper or the thumbstud.</p><p>Slightly smaller than some Hinderer pocketknives the Cryo is a superb knife for every day carry. EDC this guy for a while and we think you&rsquo;ll soon appreciate its virtues. You get the tactical hard-use looks you&rsquo;re looking for a Hinderer design and SpeedSafe opening in this amazingly affordable Kershaw that&rsquo;s destined to be the Hinderer for the rest of us.</p><p>This Kershaw spring assisted knife features a 2-3/4&quot; plain drop point blade made from 8Cr13MoV steel.</p><p>8Cr13MoV steel and the MoV (or Cr) series of steels originate from China and are equivalent to AUS-8 but containing slightly higher carbon content. You typically get great value for money with this steel and Kershaw have perfected the heat treatment process to bring out its best. 8Cr13MoV means that this knife&#39;s steel contains approximately .8% carbon and 13% Chromium. 8Cr13MoV is a very capable steel with no evident weaknesses. Leading knife makers compare it to AUS-8. It retains its edge well but is not as abrasion resistant as VG-10 or S30V. Edge stability is good which means the edge can be thinned well. We&#39;ve found that this steel is among the least complicated to hone. Kershaw&#39;s 8Cr13MoV steel is usually hardened to HRC 58-60.</p><p>Drop point blades are a style of knife blade that slopes on the spine of the blade from the handle of the knife to the tip of the blade. This allows the spine of the blade (where the blade is thicker and accordingly stronger) to continue forward to the tip of the blade. This way the point is also aligned with the center axis of the knife removing any pitch momentum when stabbing.</p><p>The curve on the top of a drop-point blade is always convex which is what distinguishes it from a clip point blade. The drop point is a common design for hunting.</p><p>This spring assisted knife has a 410/Titanium Carbo-Nitride handle.</p>",

The blade shape offers both excellent slicing and piercing capabilities and the high-performance Sandvik 14C28N stainless blade steel offers corrosion resistance and hardness. The black Blur has a DLC (Diamond-Like Carbon) coated blade for extra corrosion resistance and enhanced looks. This Blur&#39;s partially serrated blade provides additional cutting power for making short work of rope cord and other fibrous materials.<br /><br />As you might expect the black Blur has black handles with Trac-Tec grip-tape handle inserts for an extremely solid grip. The handle itself is durable 6061-T6 anodized aluminum sometimes described as &ldquo;aircraft aluminum&rdquo; since it is a common material used for aircraft fittings. But the main point is that it&rsquo;s lightweight extremely durable and&mdash;when anodized&mdash;accepts a dye so we can create colored handles that are scratch resistant and extra tough.<br /><br />For easy one-handed opening the Blur is equipped with SpeedSafe assisted opening. A short push on the thumbstud overcomes the resistance built into the torsion bar in the SpeedSafe mechanism. The SpeedSafe takes over and the blade moves out of the handle quickly and easily. One-handed opening is easy with SpeedSafe. The pocketclip is reversible for your choice of tip-up or tip-down carry. There&rsquo;s even a pre-drilled lanyard hole.<br />&nbsp;</p><ul>\t<li>Made in the USA</li>\t<li>SpeedSafe assisted opening</li>\t<li>Locking liner</li>\t<li>Thumbstud</li>\t<li>Reversible (tip-up/tip-down) pocketclip</li>\t<li>Steel: Sandvik 14C28N DLC coating</li>\t<li>Handle: 6061-T6 anodized aluminum Trac-Tec inserts</li>\t<li>Blade length: 3.4 in.

The Ultra-Tek is a compact sharpening steel that lets you quickly and easily touch up the edge on your Kershaw anywhere anytime. The Ultra-Tek handle is made of 6060-T6 anodized aircraft aluminum.<br /><br />Stored inside the handle is a 600-grit diamond-coated oval shaft. This is the perfect grit for restoring an edge that is in generally good shape but is just dull. Simply unscrew the shaft from the handle interior turn it around and screw it on to the other end of the handle. Now the Ultra-Tek is a comfortable 9-in. length ideal for both sharpening and realigning the edge of your Kershaw blade. To sharpen hold the blade edge against the diamond-coated shaft at about a 20-degree angle and swipe the blade from heel to tip along the sharpening shaft. Do this an even number of times on both sides of the blade. Soon your blade will be restored to it&#39;s Kershaw shaving sharp edge. It&#39;s a good idea to keep the Ultra-Tek close at hand so you can touch up the blade from time to time. If you don&#39;t let it get terribly dull it will take no time at all to maintain your edge.<br /><br />The Ultra-Tek requires no water or oil. It&#39;s lightweight and easy to use. And it stores compactly making it easy to take with you.<br />&nbsp;</p><ul>\t<li>Steel: 600-grit diamond-coated oval shaft</li>\t<li>Handle: 6061-T6 anodized aluminum</li>\t<li>Sharpening steel length: 4 in.

And if you want an eye-catching look in a new knife with the Shuffle \"snow\" you can't go wrong.</p> <p> This Kershaw folding knife features a 2-1/4\" plain drop point blade made from 8Cr13MoV steel. </p> <p> 8Cr13MoV steel and the MoV (or Cr) series of steels come from China and are comparable to AUS-8 but containing slightly higher carbon content. You routinely get great value for money with this steel and Kershaw have perfected the heat treatment process to bring out its best. 8Cr13MoV means that this knife's steel contains roughly .8% carbon and 13% Chromium. 8Cr13MoV is a very capable steel with no real weaknesses. Top knife makers compare it to AUS-8. It maintains its edge well but is not as abrasion resistant as VG-10 or S30V. Edge stability is good which means the edge can be thinned well. We've found that this steel is among the easiest to hone. Kershaw's 8Cr13MoV steel is usually hardened to HRC 58-60. </p> <p> Drop point blades are a style of knife blade that angles on the spine of the blade from the handle of the knife to the tip of the blade. This allows the spine of the blade (where the blade is thicker and thus stronger) to continue forward to the tip of the blade. This way the point is also aligned with the center axis of the knife canceling any pitch momentum when stabbing. </p> <p> The curve on the top of a drop-point blade is always convex which is what differentiates it from a clip point blade. The drop point is a standard design for hunting. </p>  <p> This folding knife has a Glass-filled Nylon/K-Texture Grip handle with a black finish.</p>",

A scope?s reticle must be precisely aligned with the weapon to ensure holdover or turret adjustments for bullet drop produce true vertical compensation for point of impact. If the crosshairs are canted left or right both elevation and windage bullet impact error will occur.</p>  <p>The Wheeler Professional Reticle Leveling System is a precision tool and technique designed to allow a scope to be perfectly leveled on any firearm with ease. CNC machining factory adjusted calibration set screws anodized aluminum construction and protective molded case put this instrument in a class of its own.</p>  <p>The system is comprised of two machined aluminum level housings calibrated to their integrated levels. The Barrel Clamp Level is attached to the guns barrel while the smaller Reference Level is placed on scope base bottom half of a ring or other flat surface perpendicular to the vertical axis of the gun. The gun is then rotated until the Reference Level is aligned. The tuning adjustment knob on the Barrel Clamp Level is then turned until its level is centered to match the Reference Level. At this point the Barrel Clamp Level is calibrated to the guns axis. The Scope can be installed loosely and the Reference Level placed on top of the scopes turret cap. The scope is rotated until the Reference Level is aligned with the Barrel Clamp Level and then simply secured in place.

Cleaning without a bore guide can allow the rod to ?bow? and rub or gouge chamber and throat of the bore causing real damage and loss of accuracy. Keeping the rod properly aligned not only protects your barrel it directs the force exerted on the cleaning rod handle allowing tight patches to be pushed more easily.</p>  <p>The AR-10 Bore Guide is precision CNC machined aluminum with a durable anodized finish.

      "description": "<p>Screwdrivers are the most important and most-used gunsmithing tools.</p> <p>Wheeler's Deluxe Gunsmithing Screwdriver Set is the kit that belongs on every gunsmithing bench - the well thought-out bit selection will put an end to burred buggered busted up screw slots on any gun that comes your way. The bits make up the heart of any screwdriver set and Wheeler's are the finest available. They're made from S2 tool steel and hardened to 56-58 Rockwell \"C.\" <p>Unlike other screwdriver suppliersWheeler's engineers measured the screws on over one hundred modern and antique firearms to make sure that we offered bits for every situation.</p> <p>Keep your gun looking and operating as good as new!</p> <p>Avoid costly damage that ruins the look and value of your guns!</p> <p>Whether you're working on a Browning Superposed a Remington 700 a Smith & Wesson revolver or a Colt Single Action you'll find that there's a bit to fit every screw on your gun. The 54 Hollow-ground flat bits range in size from .120\"x.020\" to .360\"x.070\" and includes doubles in the thinnest sizes. (Any gunsmith will tell you that you're occasionally going to break the ultra-thin bits on stubborn screws. This set includes two each of the very thinnest bits which means you'll never be stuck in the middle of a job without the proper bit. Replacement bits are available in three packs for a very modest price.)</p> <p>The set also includes a complete selection of Phillips Allen and Torx bits to cover scope rings bases recoil pads and the like. <p>The difference in the \"basic set\" and the \"professional set\" lies in the 15 ingenious \"specialty bits\" that are included in the \"professional\" set. These 15 pieces include all of the bits pictured below. These bits are great for installing scope bases getting you out of a pinch by providing a small pin punch when you really need it and keeping once-in-a-while lifesaver tools at your fingertips.</p> <p>Both sets come with two handles made from comfortable overmolded plastic. The first is a regular size handle that's good for most jobs and the second is a slimmer shorter \"Close Quarters\" handle that is good for finesse work with smaller bits.</p> <p>Both sets also come in a durable custom box that's ready for the bench or your range kit.</p>   <ul><li>Case Size: 8 in. x12 in. x3 in.  </li><li>Bit Material: S2 Tool Steel </li><li>Bit Hardness: 56-58 Rockwell C </li><li>Driver Handles: 2 with magnets Extension: 1 3 in. with magnet </li><li>Adapter: 1 Hex to square drive </li><li>Flat Bits: 54 Hollow-Ground </li><li>Allen Bits: 8 </li><li>Phillips Bits: 4 </li><li>Torx Bits: 3 </li><li>Specialty Bits: 15</li></ul>",

The curved edge on the steel scraper is engineered to make scraping a pile of magnesium easier. The straight edge struck against the flint rod acts as your flint and steel creating a shower of sparks to ignite the magnesium and light your kindling. The Mag Striker makes starting a fire easier even with cold fingers or in survival situations. A bottle opener is included on the steel striker so you can relax with a cold beverage once your fire is burning steadily.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Stripped down to the bare necessities. Sometimes the best tool for the job is the simplest. The Razel&nbsp;Chisel is a fixed blade for your pocket that takes a no-frills approach to Jon Graham&rsquo;s iconic original design. Made of high-carbon steel and using a chisel grind that&rsquo;s sharpened on a single side the blade is incredibly easy to resharpen. The bare metal handle keeps weight to a minimum while the included cord fob extends the grip for better control.<br /><br />When it&rsquo;s time to get down to business this knife delivers.

      "description": "<p>This tactically inspired everyday carry knife with a uniquely etched blade and cord wrapped ray-skin style handle is the true epitome of cool.</p><p>Designed by Lucas Burnley of Albuquerque NM the Obake is an artful combination of a classical knife style built with modern-day materials and techniques. It&#39;s another example of Burnley&#39;s belief that knives are a personal expression of independence. And this one makes a statement when you bring it out for action.</p><p>A throwback to a classic Japanese Kwaiken design it features a full tang fixed blade with a unique gray titanium nitride finish that&#39;s acid-etched to give each knife a distinct look. It&#39;s like he made the blade exclusively for you to throw down when the need for utility comes up.</p><p>The handle has a Katana style nylon cord wrap over a black faux ray-skin for an exceptional and secure all-weather grip. When storms or trouble are brewing you&#39;ll be ready.</p><p>The sheath of the Obake is made from glass-reinforced nylon that provides consistent retention even in humid environments. A paracord lanyard on the sheath is designed to attach to your belt loop and keep the sheath in place when you deploy the knife. A skull bead adds a not-so-subtle accent to the paracord lanyard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The Provoke&nbsp;EDC features a new plain-edge blade made from D2 steel for excellent edge retention and a lightweight aluminum handle that allows it to ride comfortably in a pocket.<br /><br />The Kinematic&nbsp;opening mechanism has pulled the folder into the future&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s ready or not. Thumb pressure on the upper crossbar sets the chain reaction in motion causing the blade to lunge open while you&rsquo;ve got a firm grasp on the handle. It&rsquo;s crafted of aircraft-grade 6061 aluminum for supreme toughness. Although it looks complex this system is easy to use fast and safe.</p>",

      "description": "<p>This large folding tactical knife answers the call with a big deep-bellied spear-point blade that cuts through anything. AutoLAWKS safety and a dual hilt blade guard round out the features. This is a knife that&#39;s as specialized as those who use it.</p><p>Designed by legendary knifemaker Harold (Kit) Carson of Vine Grove KY the M21-14SFG offers a combination of Carson Series features requested by military procurement specialists. Being a retired Master Sergeant Kit was happy to oblige.</p><p>This specialty knife features a beast of a blade. Crafted from high carbon stainless steel with CRKT&#39;s exclusive patented Veff Serrations it&#39;s ideal for cutting rope and fibrous materials dispatching obstacles moments after it&#39;s opened. Add to that a black titanium nitride coating for maximum corrosion resistance and you&#39;re good to go through anything.</p><p>A rarity in Special Forces knives the M21-14SFG also features a dual hilt blade guard to keep you safe during sustained heavy use. The patented AutoLAWKS innovation turns the folder into a virtual fixed blade by setting a safety pin against the locking liner. After all if you can&#39;t protect yourself first you can&#39;t take care of anyone else later. When you&#39;re ready for action just put a thumb on the Carson Flipper flick your wrist and the blade deploys quickly. To close the knife simply pull the AutoLAWKS red pin back slide the locking liner over and close the knife.</p><p>You work in all conditions and so should your handle. That&#39;s why we crafted it with an InterFrame build with stainless steel liners and G10 scales. They give you lightweight unparalleled grip and strength and also keep your hands cool in the summer and warm in the winter. The more you use it the more you realize how dialed in this mission ready knife is.</p><p>Reach for a Special Forces blade where the only thing special about it is&agrave;pretty much everything.</p>",
