## KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **You're not alone** - This is a massive gap for a local business. Major retailers have 50+ page legal frameworks. You have 0.

2. **Primary Arms is your benchmark** - They're professional, comprehensive, and have clearly invested in legal protection. Model your approach after them.

3. **Compliance costs money** - Expect $1,000-3,000 for attorney-drafted T&S and Privacy Policy. This is non-negotiable.

4. **Age gate is table stakes** - Every firearms site has it. It's the first line of defense legally and operationally.

5. **The gap is fixable** - You have good fundamentals (pricing, services, FFL focus). You just need the legal/compliance layer on top.

6. **Your competitive advantage** - LOCAL FFL SERVICE + LEGAL COMPLIANCE = Strong position vs. online retailers

---

## PROFESSIONAL RECOMMENDATION

**Hire a firearms attorney** to:
1. Draft Terms of Service
2. Review Privacy Policy
3. Create customer agreements
4. Advise on NICS/Form 4473 handling
5. Review website compliance
6. Create standard operating procedures

**Cost**: ~$2,000-5,000 for comprehensive review  
**ROI**: Eliminates 95% of legal liability  
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

This is **essential** before scaling beyond local operation.
