      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>Modular Gunworks was not created in a boardroom. It was built through a lifetime of real world experience.</p>
      <p>I was born and raised in Idaho where hunting, fishing, and the outdoors were part of everyday life. That foundation led me to join the United States Army where I served as a parachute rigger at Fort Richardson in Alaska. When I was not packing chutes or deployed to Afghanistan in the Khost Province, I was deep in the Alaskan wilderness hunting, fishing, and hiking.</p>
      <p>After leaving the military to start a family, my path took me to the Florida Keys. I became a scuba instructor and discovered a passion for spearfishing. That love for the outdoors eventually led me to South Padre Island, Texas, where I managed an outdoor focused business for three years. During that time I leased property to hunt hogs and deer, and night hunting for hogs and predators quickly became one of my greatest passions.</p>
      <p>Eventually I bought a sailboat and navigated the Florida Intercoastal Waterway all the way to the Bahamas. It was another chapter in a life built on adventure, discipline, and self reliance.</p>
      <p>Today I live in Alabama. I still hunt hogs with an Army buddy a few hours away, and I have taken everything I have learned from the military, the outdoors, business management, and a lifetime of hands on experience and poured it into Modular Gunworks LLC.</p>
      <p>This company is not just a business. It is the result of decades spent living the lifestyle that our customers live every day.</p>
