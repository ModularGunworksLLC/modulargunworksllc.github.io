The Rain Shell Jacket is made to keep you dry and comfortable while waiting for the birds to fly even when nature isn&#39;t&nbsp; cooperating.

Fully-taped seams ensure that these often overlooked points of entry are sealed against the elements. The outer shell fabric is tough enough to shrug off brush and has an additional water-resistant DWR coating that provides greater protection from moisture.
