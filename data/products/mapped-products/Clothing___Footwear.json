    "Web Item Description": "<p>Nothing ruins a hunt quite as quickly as a couple of frozen fingers. This is exactly why you&rsquo;ll want to keep our Nucleus Heated Softshell Gloves at the top of your must-have list from Muddy this fall. These heat-generating gloves boast three settings that keep your hands warm and fully functional and promote complete dexterity. While you wait for prime-time action to heat up choose the heat setting&mdash;low medium or high&mdash;best suited for the current conditions then let the integrated heating elements thoroughly warm your digits. When a shooting opportunity is presented flip open the top of your preferred shooting finger take the shot and then flip the magnetic closure back into place. And while cold weather equals regular deer movement throughout the day these hardworking hand warmers still account for the potential of a midday lull&mdash;helping you stay occupied thanks to tech tip index fingers that allow the use of mobile devices without ever removing them from your hands. Grip-resistant palm pads offer a rugged reinforced layer in areas where wear and tear occur most.</p><ul></ul>",

When your body can no longer generate enough of its own warmth the heating elements integrated into our Nucleus Heated Midweight Gloves can be quickly and silently activated to do the job for you. Each glove features one heating element across the back that&rsquo;s powered by a rechargeable 3500mAh battery (included). Choose from low medium or high modes using the easy-access power button on each glove and adjust as needed throughout the day. These warmth-generating gloves even help you stay occupied during midday lulls thanks to tech tip index fingers that allow using mobile devices without ever removing them from your hands. Grip-resistant palm pads extend the life of these gloves by offering a rugged reinforced layer in areas where wear and tear occur most.</p><ul></ul>",

    "Web Item Description": "<p>Early season hunting brings challenges all its own. Hot and humid conditions combined with miles of hiking can make you uncomfortable in ways that snow and cold can&#39;t. The Early Season Hooded Shirt is designed with hot late summer/early fall days in mind. The lightweight polyester fabric has 50+ UPF sun protection to guard your skin against damaging solar rays and the hood provides additional concealment from game and protection from the sun. Human scent is always a concern so Silvadur&nbsp;technology has been added to provide long-lasting odor control.&nbsp;The 3/4 length zipper and strategically-placed mesh panels on the back and underarms maximize ventilation to keep you cool. Flatlock stitching reduces chafing.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Features:</strong></h4><ul>\t<li>Lightweight polyester fabric on body</li>\t<li>Mesh panels under arms and across back for maximum breathability</li>\t<li>3-piece tailored hood</li>\t<li>Chest zipper with beard guard</li>\t<li>Zipper Napoleon pocket on chest</li>\t<li>50+ UPF protection</li>\t<li><u>Silvadur&nbsp;technology</u>&nbsp;provides long-lasting odor control</li></ul>",
