    "Web Item Description": "<p>Nothing ruins a hunt quite as quickly as a couple of frozen fingers. This is exactly why you&rsquo;ll want to keep our Nucleus Heated Softshell Gloves at the top of your must-have list from Muddy this fall. These heat-generating gloves boast three settings that keep your hands warm and fully functional and promote complete dexterity. While you wait for prime-time action to heat up choose the heat setting&mdash;low medium or high&mdash;best suited for the current conditions then let the integrated heating elements thoroughly warm your digits. When a shooting opportunity is presented flip open the top of your preferred shooting finger take the shot and then flip the magnetic closure back into place. And while cold weather equals regular deer movement throughout the day these hardworking hand warmers still account for the potential of a midday lull&mdash;helping you stay occupied thanks to tech tip index fingers that allow the use of mobile devices without ever removing them from your hands. Grip-resistant palm pads offer a rugged reinforced layer in areas where wear and tear occur most.</p><ul></ul>",

Each glove features one heating element across the back that&rsquo;s powered by a rechargeable 3500mAh battery (included). Choose from low medium or high modes using the easy-access power button on each glove and adjust as needed throughout the day. These warmth-generating gloves even help you stay occupied during midday lulls thanks to tech tip index fingers that allow using mobile devices without ever removing them from your hands. Grip-resistant palm pads extend the life of these gloves by offering a rugged reinforced layer in areas where wear and tear occur most.</p><ul></ul>",
