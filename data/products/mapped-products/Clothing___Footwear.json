    "Web Item Description": "<p>Early season hunting brings challenges all its own. Hot and humid conditions combined with miles of hiking can make you uncomfortable in ways that snow and cold can&#39;t. The Early Season Hooded Shirt is designed with hot late summer/early fall days in mind. The lightweight polyester fabric has 50+ UPF sun protection to guard your skin against damaging solar rays and the hood provides additional concealment from game and protection from the sun. Human scent is always a concern so Silvadur&nbsp;technology has been added to provide long-lasting odor control.&nbsp;The 3/4 length zipper and strategically-placed mesh panels on the back and underarms maximize ventilation to keep you cool. Flatlock stitching reduces chafing.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Features:</strong></h4><ul>\t<li>Lightweight polyester fabric on body</li>\t<li>Mesh panels under arms and across back for maximum breathability</li>\t<li>3-piece tailored hood</li>\t<li>Chest zipper with beard guard</li>\t<li>Zipper Napoleon pocket on chest</li>\t<li>50+ UPF protection</li>\t<li><u>Silvadur&nbsp;technology</u>&nbsp;provides long-lasting odor control</li></ul>",
