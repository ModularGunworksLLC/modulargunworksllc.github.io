# Age Gate Rules & Regulations (Firearms / Ammunition Industry)

## Federal law (Gun Control Act — 18 U.S.C. § 922)

**Who must follow:** Licensed dealers (FFLs) selling firearms or ammunition.

**Minimum ages from a licensee:**

| Product | Federal minimum age |
|--------|----------------------|
| Shotguns, rifles, and **ammunition for shotguns or rifles** | **18** |
| All other firearms (e.g. handguns) and **all other ammunition** (e.g. handgun ammo) | **21** |

- Licensees must follow these minimums **regardless of state law**.
- If **state or local law** sets a **higher** minimum age, the licensee must follow the **higher** requirement.

## Does federal law require a website age gate?

**No.** Federal law does **not** specify how age must be verified (e.g. no requirement for a popup, checkbox, or ID upload). It only sets the ages and says licensees may not sell to underage buyers. Liability turns on whether the licensee **knows or has reasonable cause to believe** the purchaser is underage.

A **website age gate** is an **industry best practice** and a way to show due diligence: users must affirm they meet the minimum age before browsing or buying.

## State and local rules

Some states go beyond federal law, for example:

- **Higher minimum ages** (e.g. 21 for all ammo or long guns).
- **Permits, ID, or in-person verification** for ammunition (e.g. California, New York, D.C.).
- **Restrictions on shipping** ammo or firearms to certain states.

You must comply with the **stricter** of federal and the buyer’s state/local law. Your age gate does not replace checking state rules when selling or shipping.

## How this site’s age gate aligns

- **Minimum age:** **21** (covers handguns and handgun ammo; conservative for a site that may sell both rifle and handgun ammo).
- **Behavior:** User must choose “Yes, I am 21 or older” or “No”; no bypass (no closing without choosing, no Escape).
- **Wording:** Refers to federal law and confirms the user is of legal age to purchase firearms/ammunition in their jurisdiction.
- **Persistence:** 24-hour verification (e.g. cookie/localStorage) so the gate isn’t shown on every page load.

This matches common practice for retailers like PSA, Ammo Depot, and similar, and supports compliance with federal age rules and good-faith verification.
